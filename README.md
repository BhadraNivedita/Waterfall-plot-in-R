# Waterfall-plot


A waterfall plot, also known as a waterfall chart or bridge chart, is a data visualization tool used to represent and analyze the cumulative effect of sequential positive and negative values on a starting point. It is commonly used in finance, business, and project management to illustrate how an initial value changes over time or through a series of contributing factors.

A typical waterfall plot consists of a horizontal axis that represents the categories or stages of a process or project, and a vertical axis that represents the cumulative value. The plot starts with an initial value or baseline at the left end of the horizontal axis and then shows how various positive and negative factors contribute to the cumulative value as you move from left to right along the axis.

Key components of a waterfall plot include:

1. Initial Value: This is the starting point or baseline of the plot.

2. Positive Contributions: These are the factors or categories that increase the cumulative value. They are typically represented as upward bars or columns that extend from the baseline.

3. Negative Contributions: These are the factors or categories that decrease the cumulative value. They are usually represented as downward bars or columns that extend from the baseline.

4. Cumulative Total: The cumulative total is calculated as you move from left to right along the horizontal axis, taking into account both positive and negative contributions. It is represented by the height of the bars at each point along the axis.

Waterfall plots are particularly useful for visualizing and understanding how different factors impact a particular outcome, such as changes in revenue, profit, or project completion time. They make it easy to identify which factors have the greatest influence and how they interact with one another.

Overall, waterfall plots provide a clear and intuitive way to track and explain the flow of values from one stage to the next in a process or project, making them a valuable tool for decision-making and communication in various fields.
